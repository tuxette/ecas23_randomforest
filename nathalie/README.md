# Welcome to Nathalie's subrepository!

Welcome to this repository! I will regularly update this README file to let you
know when some of the materials that I am preparing for this class is ready. 
You will also find detailed installation instructions for the practical sessions
here (maybe, if I'm inspired) as advices to be sure to be able to run the code 
prepared for these sessions during the class.

Do not hesitate to contact me (preferentially **before** the beginning of the
class) using the contact information available on my 
[professional website](http://www.nathalievialaneix.eu/).

## Material

My class will cover 2-3 topics, including:

* **random forest for functional data analysis** (e.g., mostly time series)
  * [slides (theoretical part)](http://www.nathalievialaneix.eu/doc/pdf/2023-10-09_vialaneix_ECASSFdS2023-FDA.pdf) 
  are ready! You are welcome to download them. Minor changes can be introduced 
  later in these slides. The last version is of *September 7th, 2023*.
  * practical part on "Using random forest for functional data with time-series 
  random forest and BOSS random forest": 
  [Analysis of the GunPoint dataset](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1PXkbIhrC0YkJ2UoWJe2edWsm6NoGHJhs?usp=sharing) 
  shared through [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com). This file is
  a Jupyter notebook also available in the directory `fda/practical` of this 
  repository. You are free to either: i) use it directly on Google Colab by 
  creating a copy (File / Save a copy in drive), ii) use it on your own computer
  (be sure to have the necessary Python libraries installed), or iii) use it in 
  a RStudio cloud account.
  
## Technical information

I am using Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (xubuntu distribution) and can probably help you
install R and Python packages and librairies on this distribution providing that
you send me complete description of the errors (screenshots are welcome).

- *Python configuration*: On my computer, I am using Python 3.10.12 with Jupyter
notebook (6.4.12). The following librairies are required for the notebooks (versions are given for the records but the Google Colab versions are not the same and the notebook works perfectly):
  - matplotlib          3.6.2
  - numpy               1.23.5
  - pyts                0.13.0
  - session_info        1.0.0
  - sklearn             1.3.0
- *R configuration*:
