# Welcome to Nathalie's subrepository!

Welcome to this repository! I will regularly update this README file to let you
know when some of the materials that I am preparing for this class is ready. 
You will also find detailed installation instructions for the practical sessions
here (maybe, if I'm inspired) as advices to be sure to be able to run the code 
prepared for these sessions during the class.

Do not hesitate to contact me (preferentially **before** the beginning of the
class) using the contact information available on my 
[professional website](http://www.nathalievialaneix.eu/).

My class will cover 2-3 topics, including:

* **random forest for functional data analysis** (e.g., mostly time series)
  * [slides (theoretical part)](http://www.nathalievialaneix.eu/doc/pdf/2023-10-09_vialaneix_ECASSFdS2023-FDA.pdf) 
  are ready! You are welcome to download them. Minor changes can be introduced 
  later in these slides. The last version is of *September 7th, 2023*.
