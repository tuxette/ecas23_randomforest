# Welcome to Nathalie's subrepository!

Welcome to this repository! I will regularly update this README file to let you
know when some of the materials that I am preparing for this class is ready. 
You will also find here detailed installation instructions for the practical
sessions as well (maybe, if I'm inspired) as advices to be sure to be able to 
run the code prepared for these sessions during the class.

Do not hesitate to contact me (preferentially **before** the beginning of the
class) using the contact information available on my 
[professional website](http://www.nathalievialaneix.eu/).
