# Welcome to Pierre's subrepository!

I will give two lectures at the school (see below). The materials for my lectures will be made available below soon (sorry for the delay).

For the practical part, I will use the [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) python library through a jupyter notebook. Each lecture will have its own subdirectory with the notebook and some additional files. You can then either:
* open the notebook in [Google colab](https://colab.research.google.com/). There will then be some instructions to uncomment at the beginning of the notebook to install the required libraries and download the additional files.
* or open it on your own computer. I recommend to use [JupyterLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) for that. Once you have installed Python as instructed on the github's [main page](../README.md), you can start JupyterLab by simply typing `jupyter lab` in a shell (or 'Anaconda prompt' on windows). This will open automatically a browser and start JupyterLab. You can then open the notebook in the File browser in the left window.
